VERTICAL FARM MAKER


-building space
	-width
	-height


Growing spaces:
	-lighting
	-water
	

Costing:


Produce:






Plan:
implement building a structure
	-UI                                         seeds, machinery, structure(metal, tubing,
	-Materials
		-cost


adding resources to structure


add costing to structure
	-cost of land
	-cost of structure
	-cost of seeds
	-cost of cost of water
	-cost of workers 

outcomes of growing
	-volume of output
	-



Plan for making:

set up scenes:
	-main menu
		-buttons
	-settings (input specific costing)
		-default value of costs, but can be inputted by customer
	-building mode
		- drag and drop from list on bottom, cant edit width and height, only add extra structure
		-room (8mx8mx3m)
		-nessesity for stairs&/or lift
		-cost to connect rooms
		-cost to made new tier
		
	-saved builds
		-can be saved to a file, and can be read to be imported





Everything is too complicated, this needs to be a simple, quick to use application that doesnt require any fiddly, janky concepts
only numbers inputted

this "game" is a shadow of what it used to be, it was going to be simple, go into a world where you can use different 
resources and buildings to make a cool, stylish vertical farm however i evaluated who my target audience is for this. 
This isnt a game, it has no re-playabilitythe only fun to be had was making a somewhat 'cool' structure using as 
little resources and making the most profitable farm, but as the target audience for this is a buisness trying to make one, 
they dont want to take a while to build something, they want it quick and easy... 
So my idea was then condensed into just spawning into a word where there is only building, 3 clicks, 1 to start in a corner, 
2nd to finalized making the floor, finally 3rd seeing how high to go, but again this doesnt help, as the audience wants
this to be fast, they dont was to have to take a while to get the height just right, they just want to input... and so, 
my idea is finally fully condensed, all the user does is input numbers, then recieve numbers, and a nice little graphic
shows what the build could look like.



questions:



Dimensions: 
width and height-

	-small: 5m-10m x 5-10m  x 10m-20m min:500m max: 2000m  
	-medium: 10-30m x 10m-30m x 20m-50m min:2000m max: 45000m 
	-large: 30m- x 30m- x 50m- 
	
dont know- random w&h 

What will be the cost of this land per acre?

-price
-dont know -inputs default value

Is there already infastructure, you will it need to be built?

yes- continue
no- 	please input an estimate of the cost to build simple infastructure (not including building the farms):
		-price added to end
		-dont know -assumes yes is given to previous question

Will you have sustainable sources of electricity or use the grid:
yes: no money added
no: 
small:-electic: £3000         
medium:-electric: £6000
large:-electric: £11000

Will you be selling a veriety of things?
	-yes
	-no	-what amount will you roughly recieve per 1kg of produce sold?



assumptions: 
water = 50l per m^2 per year
water = 0.184p per liter
1 acre = £6979
equiptment = £490/m^2



Things to add:
